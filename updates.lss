--Shake now has X and Y values
--Bloom now has Diffusion, Threshold, Anamorphic Ratio and Color
--Vignette now has Color
--Lens now has Center X / Y, Intensity X / Y and Scale
--New Keyframe: Camera Offset (Moves the camera at an offset from the current Move values. Good for layering animations much like layering animations with parenting.)
--New Keyframe: Gradient (Offers an overlay that covers the entire screen with two colors in a gradient. Basically works the same as Editor Alpha gradient, but has a new option: "Mode")
--New Keyframe: DoubleVision (Blurs the screen in two directions, creating a "doubled vision" effect as the name implies)
--New Keyframe: ScanLines (Overlays the screen with lines similar to analog TV screens)
--New Keyframe: Blur (Blurs the screen with custom iterations)
--New Keyframe: Pixelize (Makes the screen more pixel-y)
--New Keyframe: BG Color (Allows you to change the color of the BG without having to change the theme. You can change the color to any of the object colors, same with every other color value in an event keyframe)
--New Keyframe: Screen Overlay (A specific color is overlayed on the screen with customizable transparency)
--New Keyframe: Timeline (Set the timeline inactive or move it around to wherever you want, or even set a custom color)
-Moved some more editor functionality to EditorManagement, so you do need EditorManagement in order to use these features in the editor.

--New Keyframe: Ripples (Water-like effect)
--New Keyframe: RadialBlur (Super intense blur effect)
